# odin-recipes
This is my first HTML project. It features actual Filipino recipes I've learnt from my mother.

By completing this project, I'm able to showcase the following:
- Making frequent commits, which reflect the significant updates I've made along the way
- Becoming more comfortable with the Git Workflow and using basic Git commands in the terminal
- Applying the html boilerplate and the different html elements I've learnt in previous lessons
