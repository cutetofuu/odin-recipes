        <p>Lumpiang Shanghai are Filipino-style spring rolls made up of ground pork, onions and carrots wrapped in thin spring roll wrappers. My Mama used to cook big batches of lumpia for our family and we would eat them with rice, and then usually end up eating a few more on their own!</p>
    
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>500g ground pork</li>
            <li>1 medium carrot minced</li>
            <li>1 medium onion minced</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>At least 30 pieces of small spring roll wrappers</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil for deep frying</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine all ingredients in a bowl, except for the last 2 ingredients. Mix well using your hand.</li>
            <li>Carefully separate the spring roll wrappers.</li>
            <li>Place a wrapper on a flat surface, positioned like a diamond. Scoop approximately 1 tablespoon of the mixture near the bottom corner of the spring roll wrapper. Spread the mixture and then fold the bottom corner of the wrapper upwards. Then fold the side corners of the wrapper inwards. Roll the folded portion of the wrapper all the way up to the top corner to finish wrapping the lumpia. Brush the end of the top corner with either water or a beaten egg mixture to seal the wrapper in place.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a frying pan or a deep fryer over medium heat. Ideally it should be high enough to cover the lumpia.</li>
            <li>Deep fry the lumpia for 5-7 minutes or until it is golden brown.</li>
            <li>Remove the lumpia and let the excess oil drain.</li>
            <li>Serve with chili sauce or ketchup and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
