        <p>Pancit Bihon is a Filipino stir-fried dish that usually consists of vermicelli noodles cooked with soy sauce, chopped vegetables, meat and/or seafood. For my Mama's version, I'll be using shredded chicken with carrots, cabbage and snow peas. She also likes adding chorizo bits to give it that extra flavour and colour.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1b rice (vermicelli) noodles</li>
            <li>2 chicken breasts cooked, deboned and shredded</li>
            <li>1 cup snow peas</li>
            <li>1 carrot julienned</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded cabbage</li>
            <li>1 medium-sized onion chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>5 tbsps soy sauce</li>
            <li>3 to 4 cups of water or chicken stock</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large wok, saute the garlic and onion.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken, season with salt and black pepper, and cook for 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add soy sauce and let it cook for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add carrots and snow peas and cook for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add water or chicken stock and let it boil. Then add the rice noodles and set the heat to the lowest setting to allow the noodles to cook slowly.</li>
            <li>Once the noodles are cooked, add cabbage and cook until most of the broth has evaporated.</li>
            <li>Add chorizo and cook for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve with calamansi or lemon and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
