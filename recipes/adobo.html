        <h2>What is chicken adobo?</h2>
        <p>Chicken adobo is a classic Filipino dish made by marinating chicken in soy sauce, white vinegar and spices. The chicken is simmered in the sauce, making is tender and intensely flavourful. My mama prefers to pan-fry the chicken until the sauce dries up, leaving us with sweet, sticky and slightly tangy chicken.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 kg chicken (thighs, legs or breasts can be used)</li>
            <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 cloves crushed garlic</li>
            <li>4 bay leaves</li>
            <li>1 tbsp black peppercorns</li>

            <li>1/3 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
